    "\n",
    "    \"r\" (read mode): This is the default mode for opening a file. In this mode, the file is opened for reading only, and the file pointer is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exist, an IOError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"w\" (write mode): In this mode, the file is opened for writing only. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"a\" (append mode): In this mode, the file is opened for writing, but new data is appended to the end of the file instead of overwriting its contents. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"x\" (exclusive creation mode): In this mode, the file is opened for writing, but only if it does not already exist. If the file exists, a FileExistsError is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"b\" (binary mode): This mode is used to read or write binary data to a file. When this mode is used, the data is read or written as bytes rather than as text. For example, when writing to a binary file, the data is written as bytes instead of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"t\" (text mode): This mode is used to read or write text data to a file. When this mode is used, the data is read or written as characters rather than as bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \"+\" (read/write mode): This mode allows the file to be opened for both reading and writing."
